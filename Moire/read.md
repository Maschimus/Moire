# Capture a smile on paper
Take a nice moment and have it printed on 
 paper and make it alive. I will show you how:
<br/>
This program uses Moiré interference to make your moving pictures easily! All you need is a series of pictures you want to have animated. 
## Moiré effect- A Introduction
The Moiré effect is optical interference effect. Two or more overlapping grids interfere and create a interference pattern. 
An example is shown 
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Moir%C3%A9.gif).

### What you need
* Your series of pictures
* Printer 
* Normal and transparent paper
### Remarks from science
 The spacial size of the interference pattern is bigger than the spatial pattern of the initial grids. <br/>
A very interesting field of field of application is SIM (Structered ilummiation microscopy). The sample is illuminated 
with a specially designed (sinusoidal) grid. Due to the interference larger interference pattern will result. This can be 
measured and the originally (smaller) pattern can be recalculated. The world best microscopes use this trick!

## How it works
### Choose you files
Take two or more pictures of you that you want to have in motion.
### Use the code
Follow the program guide below to create the Moiré Template.
### Print name on paper 
You will find 3 files in the Output folder:
* animated-moire.gif: An animated preview of your result
* moire.png : Your Moiré picture. Print it on normal paper!
* pattern.png The second grid. Print it on transparent paper!  



## The Program guide
The program does not use the classical Moiréeffect. It rather stores the information of one picture in one "strip" of the output Moiré picture. So n pictures have n repeating stripes. <br/>
 The second pattern consists of blocks of stripes with the same size. All of the stripes are black except one that is transparent. With this you "hide" all slide and pictures under the black slides except the one under the transparent part. By sliding horizontally, you change the visible picture and you see motion -great!


### Loading the data
Choose your png or jpeg files. <br/> You don't have the work on pictures, you will make them black and white during the process, but for the better results other programs like gimp, Adobe will result in greater results.
<br/>
For the better flow, we recommend to take a video and extract 4 to 8 pictures for the best effect! This way it will look smooth!

### Saturation level
Get a preview of your binarized data and choose a threshold level.<br>
The higher the level the higher the contrast. Choose the advanced option for more exact adjusting.<br/>
Press show to update the threshold-level.
### Advanced option
For all those:
-Choose 0 of greyscale and so on

### Stipe width
Choose the width of the stripes. <br/>
A finer bining means more resolution, but may weaken the effect. The best is, if the change of your picture is within the size of a bin. It will look amazing then!
<br/>
Play around and press show to see you updates.


### Gif animation example
The page will show you a preview of your data. <br>
Be patient the window with your gif will open in a couple of seconds! <br/>
If you are happy press finish, otherwise back and choose other options for our perfect animation!
<br/>
Close the window and press "show again" to see the full animated gif again!
<br/> <br/>
Have fun
